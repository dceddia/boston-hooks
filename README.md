Each commit in this project corresponds to one of the examples from my [Guided Tour of Hooks talk](https://daveceddia.com/hooks-boston) on 11/20/18.

Clone this, run `git log` to see the available examples, and `git checkout <hash>` to look at a specific one.

Run `yarn` to install packages, and `yarn start` to start up the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
